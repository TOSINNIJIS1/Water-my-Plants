                <h4> How might we help planters remember to water their plants? </h4>
                <p> The problem is pretty broad. I thought maybe everybody needed watering reminder. But my mother who is an avid gardner seemed to not need any help remembering to water. So I asked: </p>

                <div class='a'>
                    <span> a. </span>
                    <p> who needs reminder to water their plants? </p>
                </div>

                <div class='b'>
                    <span> b. </span>
                    <p> what are they using now to remember to water? </p>
                </div>

                <div class='c'>
                    <span> c. </span>
                    <p> what factors are contributing to their plants growth or deterioration? </p>
